# WordleSolver

This project currently has two implementations: a Python version and a c++ port. While they share a common goal, their feature sets are a bit different.

---

## Python Version

The Python implementation provides expanded functionality and automation features:

### NYTimes Wordle *(Latest Answer Only)*

- Fetches and displays the **latest official answer**
- Designed for quick retrieval and reference
- No automation or solver functionality for NYTimes


### Wordle Unlimited *(Auto Solver)*

- Fully supports **Wordle Unlimited**
- Includes an **automatic solver**
- Can solve multiple puzzles in sequence
- Number of puzzles solved depends on the user-selected amount

### External Dependencies
##### NYTimes
- Requests (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
##### Wordle Unlimited
- Selenium (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium)
- Chromedriver (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads)
- Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/)
##### Common
- Termcolor (https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/)
---

## C++ Port/Version (https://github.com/gs109111/WordleSolver/tree/cpp)

**The C++ port supports:**

- Fetching and displaying the **latest answer** from **NYTimes Wordle**
- Lightweight JSON parsing
- Fast, minimal-dependency execution

### External Dependencies
##### NYTimes
- CPR (https://github.com/libcpr/cpr)
- RapidJSON (https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson)

### Limitations

- Currently only supports **NYTimes Wordle**
- Retrieves **latest answer only**
- No auto solver functionality
- Currently no support for alternative Wordle variants
- No formatting or coloring of logs

## Design Philosophy

- This project started from the **Python version**


- **Python version** → Feature-rich and includes automation for Wordle Unlimited.
- **C++ version** → Minimal and fast port of the Python version

Future updates may expand the C++ and Python feature set
